# Convolution Neural Network Using FPGA
Overall design an FPGA implementation for convolutional neural networks where the FPGA serves as a hardware accelerator to speed up the required calculations in a convolutional network. Throughout the convolution an appropriate convolution kernel of a proper size is used which can be edited in the code.

# What it contains?
- Max pooling
- Overall convolution
- Testbench

# Language used
- Verilog

# Tools used
- ModelSim
- Xilinix
